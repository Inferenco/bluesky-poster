# Voice Guidelines

## Tone
- Direct and confident, never wishy-washy
- Professional but approachable
- Conversational without being overly casual

## Structure
- Lead with the key insight or value proposition
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- End with a subtle call to action when appropriate

## Formatting Rules
- NEVER use hashtags (they look spammy on Bluesky)
- Avoid emoji unless the topic specifically calls for it
- Include links only when they add genuine value
- No excessive punctuation (!!!!) or ALL CAPS

## Content Guidelines
- Focus on value to the reader, not self-promotion
- Be specific rather than vague
- If sharing news/updates, add your unique perspective
- Avoid generic platitudes ("excited to announce...")

## Examples of Good Posts
- "Circle just shipped multichain wallet support. One app, multiple chains, zero bridging headaches. The UX gap is closing fast."
- "Hot take: Most AI prompts fail because they're too vague. Specificity is the secret sauce. Thread incoming tomorrow."

## Examples to Avoid
- "🚀🚀🚀 HUGE NEWS! We're so excited to announce..."
- "Check out this amazing thing! #crypto #web3 #blockchain"
- "I'm humbled and honored to share..."
